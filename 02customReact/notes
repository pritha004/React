- Bundlers(like babel) converts the jsx to more simpler syntax like we have declared in our custom react app as 'reactElement'. This custom way of creating element is defined by us.

const reactElement={
    type: 'a',
    props: {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    children: 'Click me to visit google'
}

- Babel or other bundlers are used to convert JSX to JS. A simple 'a' tag gets converted in below code behind the scene. In React, we can also create the element using below method but a Bundler makes it simple for us by allowing to use JSX.

const reactElement= React.createElement(
    'a',
    {
        href: 'https://google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    "Click me to visit google"
)
